# go_rss_aggregator
 Guided project from [boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev/assignments/90609135-23e0-472e-aded-da7ac2d22cdc).

## Motivation
Having done the [go_web_server](https://github.com/aliasboink/go_web_server) this is the natural continuation of learning Golang. In this project I created an API utilizing a `posgresql` database. I've followed the steps from the Guided Project and only looked at some mild assitance for the SQL/postgresql parts. 
This will serve as the foundation for a future project which will be a stripped down version of this API turned into a helmchart and then deployed via K3s on a Raspberry PI. It will be exposed to the dangers of the internet via a CF tunnel using a domain registed with CloudFlare.
